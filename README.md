Description:
The Depression Self-Test Web App is a simple, interactive tool designed to help users assess symptoms of depression through a set of 15 questions. Built using front-end web technologies, it allows users to select answers, calculates a score, and provides an assessment ranging from "Minimal Depression" to "Severe Depression."

Technologies Used:
HTML structures the content, including questions and radio buttons.

CSS styles the interface with gradients, shadows, and responsive layout for a clean, user-friendly look.

JavaScript handles quiz logic, scoring, and dynamically updates the page content without refreshing.

All code runs in the browser without needing a backend or database, making the app lightweight and fast.

Platform/Editor:
This project was developed using Visual Studio Code, a popular code editor for web development. The app can be opened in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and can be hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify.

Applications:
Mental health awareness campaigns

School/college wellness portals

Online therapy or telehealth sites

Employee wellness programs

NGO or public health outreach tools

Itâ€™s ideal for quick, private self-assessment and can guide users toward seeking professional help if needed.

Conclusion:
This project showcases how basic web development skills can be applied to support mental health. With clean design and simple functionality, it can be expanded into larger platforms or mobile apps to reach a broader audience.
